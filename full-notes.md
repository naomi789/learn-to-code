# What is "coding"? 
 - Writing/creating instructions that a computer can understand and execute to:
   - Create, read, update, delete data
   - Create websites, apps, software
 - It's often compared to writing a recipe - but a very exact recipe

# Programming languages
## What is a programming language? 
 - " a system of notation for writing computer programs... a kind of computer language." [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language)
 - It is made up of both "syntax (form) and semantics (meaning), which are usually defined by a formal language." [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language)
 
## Where do programming languages come from? 
 - Academic institutions, industry, open source, etc. 
 - Why? Usually either for fun or to address problems or limitations that an exisiting language has
   - Make syntax easier to read & write (reducing risk of errors)
   - To improve performance (often for a particular platform
   - To expirment with new ideas (and maybe provide a competitive advantage) 

## Why are there updates and new versions of programming languages? 
 - Fixing bugs and security vulnerabilities
 - Adding new features
 - Improving performance
 - Maintaining compatibility 
 - Enhancing usability
 - etc. 
 
## How do programming languages work? 
1. Person writes code
2. Code is either
 - Compiled (converted directly into machine code that can be executed by a computer)
 - Executed (translated into machine code at runtime, as they are executed by a computer)
3. Code is executed by the computer
4. Output may (or may not) be created

## Types of programming langauges
There are lots of different ways to do this! It's like asking someone what kinds of salads there are. 

Types of salads: 
 - What types of salads are there? 
   - caesar v. ceviche v. coleslaw v. cobb salad... 

 - What situation do these salads work in? (what can you accomplish with this programming language?)
   - Different courses: side salads v. main course salads v. dessert salads
   - Different situations: formal v. casual settings
   - Ingredients: romaine lettuce, iceberg lettuce, etc... 
   - Allergens: salads that have peanuts, salads that have walnuts...
  
 - What salad do you want to have now? (what programming language would "hit the spot" for you?)
   - This probably comes down to some of the factor's we've already discussed
   - Maybe you feel like some salads are "real" or "fake": "fruit salad" or "pasta salad" or "chicken salad sandwiches" or "jello salad"... are these real salads?

# Programmer culture
## Historical stuff
 - [README files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/README) have been around since the 1970s
 - [Hackathons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon) have been around since the 1990s
 - The website [Stack Exchange](https://stackexchange.com/) was modeled after the site [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) (questions about programming that are tightly focused on a specific problem and users' answers) which was named after the bug, [stack overflow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_overflow), which occur if the call stack pointer exceeds the stack bound.

# Learning to Code
## How to pick a language? 
1. Consider your goals (make a website, build an app, analyze data, etc)
2. Pick a "beginner-friendly" language (Python and Java are often recommended; as are HTML/CSS, R, and SQL)
3. Consider the community (tutorials, documentation, online forums, etc)
4. Be patient & open to switching languages

## How to pick a class? 
Consider whether you have a preference around: 
 - Course content (introductory v. advanced concepts? Quizzes? Online forums?)
 - Course format (reading? lectures to watch?)
 - Course duration (self-paced? hours? months?)
 - Instructor quality
 - Program quality
 - Certificate, degree, neither? 

## Python
### About Python

## Introductory SQL
 - Programming language designed for managing and manipulating relational databases
 - Four essential operations for creating and managing persistent databases are "CRUD" = Create, Read, Update, Delete
 - Pros
   - Simple syntax and clear structure
   - Widely used and supported 
   - Can scale up as data volumes grow & efficient with relational databases
 - Cons
   - Not great with processing data (even thought SQL is good at retrieving and processing data)
   - All programming languages for relational databases: 
     - Can be vulnerable to security risks (like SQL injection)
     - Changes to the database may mean your SQL code will no longer work
     - Not great with unstructured data (images, videos, audio files) or semi-structured data (hierarchical data like trees or graphs, XML, JSON)

## HTML & CSS Templates
 - Often when you google for HTML templates, sites like [Wix](https://www.wix.com/), [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/), [Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com/), [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/), pop up. These are fine, but are geared towards drag and drop "coding" instead of writing HTML and CSS. Also - they usually charge you a monthly/quarterly fee!
