# Learning to code
## What is this repo? 
Naomi's 60 minute learn-to-code workshop. I'll take you all the way from "Hello World" (in Python &amp; HTML) to setting up your own static GitHub Page (HTML &amp; CSS)!

# What is "coding"? 
 - 

# What is a programming language? 
 - " a system of notation for writing computer programs... a kind of computer language." [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language)
 - It is made up of both "syntax (form) and semantics (meaning), which are usually defined by a formal language." [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language)
 
## How do programming languages work? 

## Types of programming langauges
There are lots of different ways to do this! It's like asking someone what kinds of salads there are. 

Types of salads: 
 - What types of salads are there? 
   - caesar v. ceviche v. coleslaw v. cobb salad... 

 - What situation do these salads work in? (what can you accomplish with this programming language?)
   - Different courses: side salads v. main course salads v. dessert salads
   - Different situations: formal v. casual settings
   - Ingredients: romaine lettuce, iceberg lettuce, etc... 
   - Allergens: salads that have peanuts, salads that have walnuts...
  
 - What salad do you want to have now? (what programming language would "hit the spot" for you?)
   - This probably comes down to some of the factor's we've already discussed
   - Maybe you feel like some salads are "real" or "fake": "fruit salad" or "pasta salad" or "chicken salad sandwiches" or "jello salad"... are these real salads?
   
Types of languages: 
 - Low level v. High level languages
 - Compiled v. Interpreted languages
 - Typing
   - static v. dynamic typing
   - strong v. weak typing
 - Procedural v. declarative languages
 - Compiled v. Just-in-Time (JIT) languages 
 - Event driven v. threaded programming
 - Language purpose
   - Domain-specific languages
   - Markup language
   - Scripting languages
   - Object oriented
   - Functional programming languages
   
"There is no overarching classification scheme for programming languages... partially because languages can be classified along multiple axes" [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language#Taxonomies)

## How do I get started? 
 - [Follow these directions](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart)
1. Create a repo name "username.github.io" (where "username" is your name)
2. Let's put some HTML in your repo
3. Turn GitHub pages on
4. Set your publishing branch (I'd recommend using your "main" branch)
5. Visit username.github.io to view your new website (it may take 10 minutes to percolate) 
6. Change your title and descreption in the _config.yml file
